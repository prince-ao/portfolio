I haven't written a single line of code in months because for the past couple of months I've been drowning in a sea of exams, papers, labs, books, podcasts, etc. but this spring break has allowed me to step back from all of that and start doing what I love.

I remember coding pre-ChatGPT with fond but very painful memories, like a released victim with Stockholm Syndrome. It took hours to scour the internet for *any* solution. The problem was obviously that I didn't understand the problem, but when it is 10:43 PM and you've been trying to understand the problem for the past ~6 hours, the last thing you want is more understanding. What you want in those moments are the solution. Its kind of like Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber's definition of a wicked problem: a problem that can be defined only after you solve it, or solve a part of it.

I've just finished setting up a proxy server / regular server for the domain http://princeaddo.com using nginx; http://princeaddo.com/ is a proxy server and http://princeaddo.com/blog/ serves Hugo generated files. I don't fully understand what I did, but it works. And its thanks to ChatGPT. In a world where ChatGPT didn't exist I would have to gain expert knowledge of Hugo and Nginx before I could start setting up the server, which would've taken at least 10 hours, but using ChatGPT it took around 5 hours. The bulk of the problem was debugging the incorrect solution that it gave me, at times I would ask it if it was sure that the response it generated was correct and it would surprisingly fix it. But ChatGPT would generate nuggets of truth, and piece by piece I built on top of them to solve the problem. The journey was analogous to a blind person making down an ally that they've never been through. ChatGPT creates a new paradigm in development, a paradigm of abundance instead of scarcity. I smile more when I code now because in the back of my mind I know that if I ever get stuck on a really hard problem, I can just ask ChatGPT. This allows me to actually spend hours learning a tool that I need because I know that my time will not be wasted, I can always refer back to ChatGPT.

Its hard to think of any negative to using ChatGPT in this particular instance. Sure I didn't get to learn Hugo, but I didn't want to learn it anyways, I just wanted to use it to generate this blog(although I do wish I learned Nginx). A lot of life is just doing stuff so you can actually do what you want. Studying so you can pass your test, doing well in your undergraduate so you can get the dream job, working out so you can get the dream body. Maybe there's value to doing the boring/hard stuff, and I can see how that could be/is the case, but there must be a case where the boring/hard stuff is just boring and hard that skipping it with a tool would be morally ok, and I think Hugo is one of the cases.

Overall I think ChatGPT should be used with balance so you can learn and at the same time get work done. If you have expert level experience in a certain topic, you can use ChatGPT's insights more effectively and figure out when its hallucinating. Maybe a good heuristic for the question "when should you use ChatGPT?"(or even AI in general) is whenever you know the subject well enough that you wouldn't need ChatGPT or when the subject is so irrelevant that you will be willing to not learn it and deal with the repercussions of ignorance.
