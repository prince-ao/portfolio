"Hello World!"

Those are the words that are uttered by a programmer's first program. At least in theory; 

by the time I had my hello world moment I was pretty good at writing code.

This blog is intended to catalog my ideas and thoughts; but I am not a writer nor have 

I retained much of the syntax and grammar rules from elementary school, so

you will have to bear with that as you read through my writings. I also don't aspire to 

become a professional writer, so I don't intend to talk much about grammar, unless its programming 

language grammar. If you're a complete stranger on the world wide web, welcome to my little 

corner of the internet(literally, this blog is being hosting on a raspberry pi in the corner of my room);

in this blog I'm hoping to express complex ideas in a simple manner and I believe I'm the right 

person for that because I was not long ago a complete moron when it came to coding, and I still 

am to a lesser degree, so I can understand a moron's perspective. This blog is a work in progress;

I'm content with how it looks right now, but it will definitely change in the future.

If you see a bug, its not a bug... Its a feature.</pre>`,
